NOTE: Statistics were generated using an outdated version of DeepStrike. The version of DeepStrike used to generate the statistics for this study was trained on 194 bouts, featuring 171,301 punches thrown. All bouts were fully annotated frame by frame from start to end. The newest version of DeepStrike (as of September 2025) is trained on nearly twice as much data, 356 fights, featuring a total of 332,860 punches thrown.

Furthermore, all statistics were generated using the "dirty feed", which was uploaded to video streaming sites in either 720p or 1080p resolution. Dirty feeds only present a single view of the action at a given time and thus, are prone to occulsion issues. For optimial tracking accuracy a 4-camera system should be used so that DeepStrike can have miltiple perspectives on the action taking place.
